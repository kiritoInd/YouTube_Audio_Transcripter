Video 1," What do you think girls want from men? Good question. Do you want the truth or a lie? No, tell me. Do you want the truth or a lie? Of course. Of course, they all say truth. Well, the truth. You could just tell me the truth. Then you tell me the truth. They cry. Every time. What women want from men? Well, the first thing we have to understand is that it depends. Right? Of course, it depends. It depends on how old the woman is, what part of her life she's in, if she's looking for excitement and adventure, or if she's looking for a family and to settle down, it completely depends. But in general, if a woman is going to dedicate herself to a man, then that man has to be all-encompassing. It has to be a man who can fix most of her problems. He needs to provide stability and safety, which everybody knows. But not many people consider that he also has to provide drama for her. He also has to be entertaining for her."

Video 3," Wondering how to pass a transcription test? We are here to help you out. A general transcriptionist usually does not need prior education or experience to get transcription jobs, but must pass a test based on typing speed and accuracy in spelling and grammar. Here are some tips to remember. Firstly, you need to type fairly fast for the sake of being productive and meeting deadlines. Find out what the company's minimum typing speed is. Strictor companies tend to set a minimum level of around 50 words per minute, while more flexible firms might go as low as 25 words per minute, or perhaps no minimum at all if deadlines are not as important. You can improve your typing speed by searching for online typing tutorials. Generally speaking, your hands and fingers need to be placed properly and comfortably, instead of using the very slow one finger at a time method. Memorizing where letters and numbers are placed on the keyboard will help accelerate the learning process. Secondly, you should have a deep vocabulary and understanding a professional versus common or colloquial usage of terminology and structure. Thirdly, have spell check on your computer to double check your spelling. Fourthly, download any popular and free transcription software to help you practice transcribing before taking the test. Last but not least, adhere to instructions and follow the style guide. Proofread your work before submitting and run a spell check.

Video 4," Hello everyone. Today I would be talking about two things on lead code. One is an apparent shadow band which happens these days and the other one is a lot of post contest hacking which happens off it. Originally I did not had any plans to create a video on it and like I wanted to write a lead code blog and like and call it a day and say it to the lead code admins that you should probably stop it. But apparently I am shadow band. It's been around 24 hours since I have created this blog. But no one apart from me can read it and like if I see over here like it says like no one has viewed it here. No replies and get it around 24 hours. And when I have saved this blogging with some of my friends they even they cannot read this blog over here. Like whenever they open the URL which I say with them it essentially says that topic does not exist. It was my first blog on lead code. So assuming something good it can be the case that lead code manually reviews like the first blog submission by any user. But in my case it's around 24 hours and this blog is not approved yet. And like to first touch upon shadow band like a user recently wrote that yeah I have noticed that sometimes my decision comments get snobbed what at all. First I thought that I had forgotten to submit my post because when looked at the page from the start phone it wasn't there. I logged in and reposite but there it it was like I also I did posted this blog two times like one over here and the next time I tried to post it again. But and like I don't see any post or anything if that's the case over here. Like I did copypasted all the content and created in a new blog again but nothing happened over there. So like I have reasons to believe that like the post which I am creating on lead code is apparently said event and I do not have any reasons why it's being banned over here. Like one thing I know for the fact is like if you have been deemed in cheating or some kind of cases lead code research your coin to zero and then bans you from discuss and contest for one man. In my case like like the contest which has happened as recently as on Sunday I was able to participate. And like I also got a rating update for that contest. And like number of coins I have is a non zero as well. So at least I don't know any reason why I should be banned from writing any blog post on lead code and like that was the first topic I wanted to touch upon. So message for lead code admin says you should stop doing this. Yeah and if you are concerned about like spam over there then you should at least approve what our post legitives just create within 24 hours or something like that. Or you can have some bounds on rating or like community points whatever the user creates. And like I will add this post link in the description so you guys can read it. And the main reason why I wanted to create I have I'm for to create this blog create this video is like this blog is not published yet. So I will go ahead and read out this blog content over here and put it as a video on YouTube for others to read. So my original blog post says how to play cat and mouse game featuring lead code contest. And reading this blog post continuing reading this blog post as a prevalent intent the current lead code problems that has once again in case in post code just hacking targeting the rolling as solution for the number of sub errors that match up pattern problem which came in very recent content. And like this has resulted in three people getting hacked among top 25 users in the lead code contest 384 like two people I know who they are and I don't know the third person what I the way I have figured out is like my rating and rank jump by three points after this again happen. And I firmly oppose the notion of reasoning after the contest has concluded. And many say of this sentiment including permanent figure such as like Peter massive a former world number one competitive programmer and he wrote about this practice on lead code and like I believe a lot of people do know him like those who guys don't know him can also check his witty media page to learn more about him. Like he has like one a lot of competitions over there like in Facebook hack app and other competitions like ICPC and all like he was number one for quite a long time until he was overthrown probably by two days. So and he's a veteran. Oh, here. And like around here like this block post is 11 years old like where he wrote like he found like enough code forces command that the user submission was hacked by problem setup. Like that would have originally passed all the test cases and was not challenged. But in the end his core was reduced to zero because a test had decided to test his solution against it and add new test case that failed a user submission. And then he going forward like he wrote that this post called does hacking is awful and is awful awful decision and it goes against the split of programming competitions which is automatic design and completely objective. Like this post contest hacking by admins is neither objective and it's also not automatically. And like he said like there are so many ways this discriminates against a group like yes like you can read out the complete post again. Like he like that is the main reason and like even like few other people have written about post contest second Alex Rice who was a former lead lead code rank one also wrote about like lead code superbly get away with it. Like in my own opinion someone gets a say during our contest that AC should stand not hard to understand and has been that way forever. It's very punishing for a user to get 4 AC and then find out a week later they actually came 1000 and losing eager rating because problem organizers can't figure out how to set problems. Look it's really simple stop putting 1000 test cases in such and coming up this is it creates all bad side effects solutions with heuristic good heuristic can outperform and so on. You do not need that many test cases look at CS and CF one more issue with the lead code is like they take time limit as some of all the test cases. And like that's awful because like the time limit should be based on a particular test case only. And like this allows users to if they have some small heuristic like like this incentive is just people to reduce the average time limit rather than the maximum time limit. Which should not be the case and because of this average time limit like there are like if all the 1000 test cases are max time limit any submission you put over there will get a TLE. So like and let all codes that got AC stand at and read the whole contest if it's really bad like it's impacting a lot of users. There is the solution with python and makes sure that there is a sufficient buffer example just solution solves with 10 to 20% of the amount of time. And like this sum of time limits is particularly bad for python solutions because like on average like C++ performs much better and we are even seen that case in the previous previous contest I believe. Where and cubes solution which was not intended was passing in C++ while current solution with some extra time like current solutions were very close to getting TLE on python. Yeah like this was the problem I believe. And like. And after let go like. Like just just watch and I hope I am pronouncing the name correctly is currently second I have stated user on lead code and he also wrote let. I long run on lead code that they should not do it. I would like to say my thoughts about the format of lead code contest from a perspective of former contest session topic could. In fact I would be number one by rating now if not for last by being unwritten like he would have been the number one user if the last by weekly was under. And like here he has also said the same sentiment where he calls like in one of the recent contest lead code even went ahead and changed the constants over there which is really really awful and it has resulted in impacting few people getting run time error. Because they had a hard like they had hard coded the max limit of the area. And like a lot of people wrote about it like. And like even I wrote a comment like this would not do it. But unfortunately nothing happened after that and contest kept on again. Despite the widespread disproval it appears that these individuals are adamant about persisting with the disruptive here. I copied it from charge. Until this is their presence I am compared to introduce strategist to navigate this challenging scenario. Aiming to empower participants to maintain advantage against unfair practice in this cat and mouse games. This and their aims to set lights on absurdly of such actions. Here like I wrote like three different ways like people should be aware of to avoid has collisions going forward until lead code stops resaging problems over there. So in a cleaner sense like this there were two purpose of this block I wanted to say like I do not like it. I wanted to say like few people also say the sentiment and like I believe a lot of other people have same opinion. And at that time again like it was supposed to be an educational blog on how to avoid like a hacks or the has collisions over there. And like the issue with the last contest was like rolling a solution was heck and like if you now look at purple crown sitting. Like it has dropped by around 150 points over here in contest. He I believe he was first or something like that and like he has just fallen by 150 and like it's really really difficult to get 150 rating back at such very high rating like to get his rating back at least so he will have to win one more lead code contest again. And like that may not be enough and like say I was the case with Daniel like he also dropped by 150 rating points. And like his rank was 5000 and before the contest it was just between a single digit or double digit rank between the top first top 20 he was if I recall correctly. And like it's it just shows the incompetence of lead code problems actors to prepare it. And continuing with my blog like what techniques I wanted to introduce for people to not get hacked over here. Like the first is like you have been getting up for an upcoming fan interview and in your preparation you learn that employing a has map yields big off one time complexity. Consequently you opted to utilize STL unordered map in your lead code contest submission. However, after the contest concluded you discovered that your submission has been compromised through having through hacking. Surprise Pikachu yes you had it right it's very easy to create collisions again unordered map you can refer this blog by Neil. Whose lead code highest it is right now and like here provided like how exactly one should hack it. And like hacking is as simple as just like creating a counter test case. Like even a solution like this would create a counter test case for it. Like if you insert the multiples of 10799 and 21627 like your time complexity will just simply block because the way. Contest are written over and like you can assume like if the numbers are up to one hundred and nine it's really easy to create one and it around one hundred and nine multiples of this number. And like so and so like going forward like you should not use an order map at all. In the lead code submissions or like there is some other way to avoid hacking is by adding this snippet of port which creates a custom has map function which is randomized using the time clock. And like this ensures that your submissions like the has you have for each number it's always randomized on each and and makes it really difficult to have submissions going forward. So if you add this snippet over here and then you decide to use an order map where passing your custom has function. You would be it would be a safe max although it comes up with some time complexity. And like on average like the time taken would be relatively higher over there for due to this custom. But hey you code in Python why do you care about an order map getting acting C++. However you are a greater risk as it's even more easier to hack satan dictionary in pythons and like I don't know what you guys what people will use in case like we cannot use satan dictionary in Python. And you like there is a similar blog on port forces like how to have anti-hattest in Python as well. Like if you code on Python use satan dictionary and want to avoid this this would create an order and the way to avoid hex or is to add a custom wrapper which in fact gets random random has for each number over there. And like I will also link out this submission order like where a user has first created some wrapper and then now they have to create an interrupt in this class over here and then this would add it in count toward being hacked over here. To mitigate this thing moving forward it is advised to include the following snippet in your code and you can find sample implementation. This is the link off. And now returning to the initial hacking method targeting the rolling is for further implementation it's recommended to include three distinct modules with randomized basis. Fixed modules with two different values are susceptible to hacking and then like there are some libraries where you can just pass on a method and it will give you a string which matches like which has same rolling as over there. Like if you look at this method in this library it takes anti has it has an anti has method and it takes two pay and two bases and their modules over there and a possible alphabet size. And it like you can pass on the max length of the required length and if you do not pass any required length then it will. Then it will just find the minimum one over here and like generating like an anti has against to more less than to be nine like that's the maximum value you can take to not get an overflow when you are multiplying two numbers. Long long into overflow and this will create anti has to within three seconds and the string length is approximately faster there are some faster methods as well like which the author has not created it and like you can just copy import this library and write this code over there and it will print like all the strings you need like two strings which are same has value over them. And like to avoid it is like you can use this snippet which I have taken from capital library like where the user is taking three different mods one eight nine plus one in nine and an unsigned integer for modular to the ball 32. And like here like is first in a thing a random number based on time again and then he is using those random numbers to get a base over here. Like this see is the base and like in conclusion like I don't see like why it could have anti has collision test like although it can be a good purpose to teach people about collisions but like this just defeats the purpose where you have to now look out for strategies to avoid an ordered map instead of preparing for your next friend interview. In conclusion and note for lead code admin like that is the final paragraph again firstly allow me to introduce myself I am one of the contest admin problems at and testers opposing ICPC regional in India. It is not the privilege of being the part of team that claims the title of a service champion in the previous ICPC world finance. So I have an experience both participating as a contestant and I also have an experience being a problem setter tester over there currently I am preparing ICPC regional in India like I am one of the person who is helping out preparing ICPC regional in India and like we would be also preparing a service championship and all the contest and I did it last year to. And also I have M and ICPC world finalist although I was a last minute replacement and like I was a part of team that won the ACS champion title which essentially means my team had a best rank among the teams from India Pakistan era Bangladesh silenca like this side of the Asia. And like we were also like facilitated on like and my team was the first team from India to win this champion like this title over there and secondly I would like to address the purpose of this blog my main intention is to convert straight forward message please stop the practice of each other in contest post competition I firmly believe that most of the contest remain valid and fair without the need for a zero. The most the more frequent research here the more it reflects on the competency of your team, especially when such accents are unnecessary from outside and this is my stance on your capability here. Like there was essentially no need to create a has collision for rolling has in this problem and you might argue on like if like the cases where I keep solution did pass over here. But as it looks like from lead codes accents post contest checking where they had to they were postfully as to they were supposed to increase the constant because the current there was no way to prevent the current concerns from getting an AC on that contest over there. So like that ends my blog look okay I think NQ was not that one like it was this problem but unfortunately I did not participate in this contest so I don't know like what were the reasons to create it but yeah that's my same. And with this I will put out the video and I believe the only way like lead code stops doing this lead code stops researching problems after the contest is when everyone asked them to not hurt. Thanks everyone thanks a lot for joining today."
